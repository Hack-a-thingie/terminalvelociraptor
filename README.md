# terminalvelociraptor

This repository will be used during the Hackathingie event held at the OIST 
campus on January 7th and 8th, 2016. The goal of this project is to create a
terminal-based, academia-themed card game for future enjoyment.

We will further define the rules of the game and how we intend to complete the project during the event, so stay tuned!

Ideas in the first "design document".

- Single deck for both players.

- Deck contains: Staff and Action cards.

- Players gain Budget Points every turn (up to a maxmimum).

- Budget Points can be used to hire (play) Staff.

- Staff have Ability Points (Phys, Bio, ...).

- Ability Points can be used to play Action cards.

- Action cards can (for instance):
	* increase your maximum Budget Points available.
	* raise you Impact Factor.
	* increase number of Staff you can hire.
	* other things...

- The winner is:
	* The first to achieve X Impact Factor.
	* Other conditions (win Nobel Prize,...)
