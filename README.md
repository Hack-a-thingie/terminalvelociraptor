# terminalvelociraptor

This repository will be used during the Hackathingie event held at the OIST 
campus on January 7th and 8th, 2016. The goal of this project is to create a
terminal-based, academia-themed card game for future enjoyment.

We will further define the rules of the game and how we intend to complete the project during the event, so stay tuned!
